# **Ores Galore**

Ores Galore is a spiritual successor to the [Big Dig](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/bigdig.552679) modpack on 1.5.2, but updated to the latest Minecraft version (1.19.2) and modernized with a vast array of new features. It also, of course, has **Ores Galore**!

In "Ores Galore" you can expect to find many more ores spawning, you could even find diamonds on the surface! The average size of a ore vein (As in, how many blocks of ore it contains) is multiplied by a factor that depends on the ore (E.G. diamond ore's max size is ~4x larger, coal ore is closer to ~1.75x)

Ores Galore is, at it's most basic, a kitchen-sink pack, it has little to no gating, and very few recipe changes. If a recipe is changed, or a mod is gated behind something it's usually not, that is **only** for balance purposes. We don't want you to be stuck in something you don't want to do, but we also don't want there to be *objectively superior* ways of doing things. This is also why some machines/blocks/items are tweaked.

Ores Galore might be a kitchen-sink pack, but we by no means leave you stranded with nothing to guide you on your way. Ores galore contains many, many quests! Each mod has it's own custom quest-line that guides you through the mod, and each mod also has multiple challenge quests! These are pretty crazy! For example, what if to truly complete Mekanism, you had to make 64 digital miners! Or 512 ultimate chips!

Ores Galore doesn't make it difficult to progress in terms of power, but to beat every quest, you will have to automate a lot of stuff, and dive into a lot of mods! This is a completionist's wet dream, and nightmare, all at the same time!
